Title: Spatio-dynamic wetland plant communities model
Description: A spatio-dynamic modelling package that aims to explain the
    spatial distribution of three characteristic wetland plant communities in a
    semiarid Mediterranean wetland in response to hydrological pressures from
    the catchment. Semiarid Mediterranean saline wetlands are semi-terrestrial
    ecosystems, which yearly undergo dry periods of several months. In the last
    decades, hydrological alterations have affected characteristic wetland
    plant communities, resulting in the replacement of valuable halophilic salt
    marsh and salt steppe plant communities by more generalist and
    opportunistic taxa like reed beds ({\it Phragmites australis}). A dynamic
    model was initially developed using Stella software and then converted into
    R by means of the StellaR (http://stella-r.sourceforge.net/) software.
    Spatial dimension was added including neighborhood and spatial flows
    algorithms representing plant communities dispersion. The conversion
    between plant communities is mediated by the increase in water inflows from
    the watershedand two main wetland spatial parameters: (1) the distance to
    two ephemeral rivers crossing the wetlands and (2) the flow accumulation
    map within the wetland site. The package includes the data on waterhsed
    hydrological pressure and the initial raster maps of plant communities but
    also allows for random inital distribution of plant communities. Ongoing
    developments of package focus on offering flexible tools for creating new
    spatio-dynamic models in the next versions.
